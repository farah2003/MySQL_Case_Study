- Many to One between campaign and campaigns_statuses ( campaign has one status and the status can be for many campagins)

- Many to One between campaigns and catergories ( campaign has one category and the category can be for many campagins)

- Many to Many campaigns and users ( user donate to many campagins and campagins donated by many users)

- Many to one between donations and users and many to one between donations and campaigns ( the donation donated by one user and the donation belong to one campagin)

- Many to Many between families and campagins ( family get benfit form many campagins and campagin target many families)

- Many to One between capons and families and many to one between capons and campaigns ( the capon for one families and the capon belong to one campagin )
